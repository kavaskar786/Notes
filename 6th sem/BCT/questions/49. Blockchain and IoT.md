### **How Blockchain Enhances IoT**

1. **Decentralized Data Management**:
    
    - IoT generates vast amounts of data, traditionally managed by centralized servers. Blockchain decentralizes data storage and processing, reducing reliance on single points of control.
    - **Example**: Decentralized IoT networks can operate without intermediaries, enabling peer-to-peer communication between devices.
2. **Data Integrity and Security**:
    
    - Blockchain’s immutability ensures that IoT data cannot be altered or tampered with, enhancing trust.
    - **Example**: A blockchain-based system logs IoT sensor readings, ensuring data authenticity for audits or analysis.
3. **Scalability with Smart Contracts**:
    
    - Smart contracts automate processes and decision-making in IoT networks, reducing latency and manual intervention.
    - **Example**: Automatically triggering device actions like switching on a smart light when specific conditions are met.
4. **Enhanced Device Authentication**:
    
    - Blockchain ensures secure identity management for IoT devices, preventing unauthorized access or device spoofing.
    - **Example**: Devices register securely on a blockchain and communicate only with verified entities.
5. **Transparency in Supply Chain**:
    
    - IoT sensors collect data, while blockchain provides a transparent ledger to track goods from production to delivery.
    - **Example**: Real-time tracking of goods in the supply chain, with IoT sensors logging conditions like temperature or location.
