### **Platforms Used in Decentralization**

Decentralization involves distributing authority and decision-making across a network rather than relying on a central authority. Many platforms support decentralization by providing the infrastructure for blockchain-based applications, smart contracts, and decentralized systems. These platforms cater to various industries such as finance, supply chain, healthcare, and governance.
