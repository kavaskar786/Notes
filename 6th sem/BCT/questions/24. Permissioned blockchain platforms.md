**Permissioned blockchain platforms** are blockchain networks that restrict access to authorized participants. Unlike public blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum), where anyone can join, permissioned blockchains are designed for scenarios requiring enhanced control, privacy, and compliance, such as enterprise use cases.

Below is an overview of **key permissioned blockchain platforms**, their features, and use cases:

---

- Supports plug-and-play components like consensus mechanisms and membership services.

#### **Key Features**:

- **Modular Architecture**: Customizable consensus, data storage, and identity management.
- **Privacy**: Allows private data sharing through **channels** for confidentiality.
- **Smart Contracts**: Uses Chaincode (in languages like Go, JavaScript, or Java) for smart contracts.
- **Pluggable Consensus**: Supports consensus algorithms like RAFT or BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance).

#### **Use Cases**:

- Supply chain tracking (e.g., Walmart for food traceability).
- Trade finance and cross-border payments.
- Healthcare data management.

- Supports various consensus mechanisms, including **Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)**, which is energy-efficient.

#### **Key Features**:

- **Parallel Transaction Processing**: Improves scalability by enabling concurrent execution.
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Modular design for different consensus and transaction families.
- **Smart Contracts**: Supports multiple languages (e.g., Python, Go, and JavaScript).

#### **Use Cases**:

- IoT (Internet of Things) applications.
- Supply chain tracking and traceability.
- Digital identity management.
