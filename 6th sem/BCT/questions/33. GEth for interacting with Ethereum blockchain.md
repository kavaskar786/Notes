### **Installing Geth**

1. **Download and Install**:
    
    - Follow the instructions from the official website: [Geth Downloads](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads).
2. **Verify Installation**:
    
    - Open a terminal and run:
        
        ```bash
        geth version
        ```

### **Starting a Geth Node**

To run a Geth node, execute the following command:

```bash
geth --syncmode "light"
```

This starts Geth in light sync mode, downloading only essential data.

### **Creating a Private Ethereum Network**

1. **Initialize Genesis File**:
    
    - Create a `genesis.json` file to define the network's initial parameters:
        
        ```json
        {
          "config": {
            "chainId": 15,
            "homesteadBlock": 0,
            "eip150Block": 0,
            "eip155Block": 0,
            "eip158Block": 0
          },
          "difficulty": "1",
          "gasLimit": "8000000",
          "alloc": {}
        }
        ```
        
    - Initialize the blockchain with:
        
        ```bash
        geth init genesis.json --datadir ./my-private-chain
        ```
        
2. **Start the Network**:
    
    - Launch the node:
        
        ```bash
        geth --networkid 15 --datadir ./my-private-chain --http --http.port 8545 --http.api eth,web3,personal,net
        ```
        
3. **Enable Mining**:
    
    - Start mining for testing purposes:
        
        ```bash
        geth --mine --miner.threads 1
        ```

### **Interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain Using Geth**

1. **Geth Console**:
    
    - Access the interactive console:
        
        ```bash
        geth attach
        ```
        
    - Example commands:
        - Check balance of an account:
            
            ```javascript
            eth.getBalance("0xYourAccountAddress")
            ```
            
        - Send Ether:
            
            ```javascript
            eth.sendTransaction({from: "0xYourAccount", to: "0xRecipient", value: web3.toWei(1, "ether")})
            ```
            
2. **JSON-RPC API**:
    
    - Connect programmatically to Geth using JSON-RPC.
    - Example: Use **Web3.js** in Node.js:
        
        ```javascript
        const Web3 = require('web3');
        const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545');
        
        // Get the balance of an account
        web3.eth.getBalance('0xYourAccountAddress').then(console.log);
        ```
        
3. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
    
    - Use Geth’s console or connect it with development tools like **Truffle** or **Hardhat** to deploy and test contracts.
