## What is Blockchain?

A [blockchain](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-technology-introduction/) is a [distributed ledger technology (DLT)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-and-distributed-ledger-technology-dlt/) that consists of a growing list of records, known as blocks, that are safely connected using cryptography. Each block also includes transaction data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the preceding block (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The timestamp demonstrates that the transaction data was present at block creation. A chain is effectively formed by the blocks since each one links to the blocks before it because each block includes information about the blocks before it (see linked list data structure). Therefore, once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be undone without also undoing all subsequent blocks, making blockchain transactions irreversible.

1. **Decentralization:** Unlike traditional databases that are managed by a single entity, a blockchain is maintained by a network of computers (nodes).
2. **Transparency:** All transactions on a blockchain are visible to all participants in the network.
3. **Immutability:** Once data is recorded in a blockchain, it is almost impossible to change or delete it.
4. **Consensus Mechanisms:** To add new blocks to the chain, participants must agree on the validity of transactions through various consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (used by Bitcoin) or Proof of Stake.
5. **Security:** Transactions are grouped into blocks and linked together in a chain. Each block contains a unique code (hash) from the previous block. This chaining makes it extremely difficult to alter past transactions without changing every subsequent block.
