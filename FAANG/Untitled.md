## 🎤 **Slide 1: Title – Trunk-Based Development**

“Good [morning/afternoon], everyone.  
Today, we’re going to talk about a development model that’s reshaping how high-performing teams deliver software — **Trunk-Based Development**.

We’ll explore what it is, how it’s different, its advantages, potential risks, and a few FAQs that come up often when teams try to adopt it.”

---

## 🎤 **Slide 2: What Is Trunk-Based Development?**

“Let’s begin with the core idea.

Trunk-Based Development, or TBD, is a version control strategy where **all developers commit code directly to a shared main branch** — often called `main` or `master`.

Instead of working in long-lived branches, teams commit small, frequent changes — often multiple times a day — to the shared.

Any incomplete features are safely hidden behind **feature flags** or **toggles**.

The end goal? Always keep the codebase in a **deployable state** with every commits, with **frequent integrations**, and a **short feedback loop**.”

---

## 🎤 **Slide 3: How It Differs**

“Now, how does it differ from traditional branching models?

In GitFlow, or even basic feature-branch workflows, developers often work in **isolation** for days or weeks. That can cause **merge conflicts**, **integration pain**, and **delayed feedback**.

Trunk-Based Development **minimizes those delays**.

Everyone works off the same branch, so integration happens early and often.

Instead of managing multiple long-lived branches, you focus on **flow** — fast, small, safe contributions merged continuously.”

---

## 🎤 **Slide 4: Advantages of TBD**

“This model brings a number of powerful advantages.

First, it supports **faster release cycles** — ideal for continuous integration and deployment.

Second, you get **fewer merge conflicts**. Because changes are small and integrated frequently, they’re much easier to manage.

Third, you’ll have a **cleaner Git history**. No spaghetti of nested branches and stale features.

Fourth, it promotes **team collaboration**. Everyone works on the same codebase and shares ownership.

And finally, it encourages **high test coverage and automation**, which are critical to maintaining a stable trunk.”

---

## 🎤 **Slide 5: Risks of Trunk-Based Development**

“Of course, no model is without risks.

If your team lacks discipline, someone might accidentally break the trunk. That’s why a **solid CI pipeline**, with **linting**, **testing**, and **review gates**, is non-negotiable.

Also, without strong test coverage, you’re exposed — this model doesn’t leave room for ‘it works on my machine’ logic.

And while feature toggles are powerful, mismanaging them leads to **tech debt** and confusion in the codebase.

So, while TBD is simple in concept, **execution requires maturity** — in both tooling and team culture.”

---

## 🎤 **Slide 6: FAQ**

“Let’s cover two common questions we often hear from teams adopting this model.”

---

### ❓ Q1: What’s the maximum size a PR should be?

> “Simple rule: **keep PRs small**.  
> Under 400 lines of code.  
> Easy to review in under 30 minutes.  
> Ideally merged the same day.  
> Small PRs reduce review fatigue and speed up feedback — and they’re much safer to integrate.”

---

### ❓ Q2: Can we use feature branches at all in TBD?

> “Yes — but only short-lived ones.  
> A branch that lives for more than a couple of days isn’t aligned with Trunk-Based principles.  
> Use **feature flags** or toggles to hide incomplete features instead of branching them out.”

---

## 🎤 **Slide 7: Conclusion**

“To wrap up —

Trunk-Based Development is built for **speed**, **stability**, and **collaboration**.

It enables teams to move faster by integrating continuously, avoiding merge hell, and always keeping the code ready for production.

But it’s not a shortcut — it requires discipline, clean code, solid automation, and a strong CI/CD foundation.

Done right, it transforms how teams build software.  
It’s lean, it’s powerful — and in many modern engineering cultures, it’s becoming the new normal.

Thanks for being with me until the end of this session”
