i greatly inspired by the gateways 2023. conducted by the seniors.. it was such mesmerizing event. so i also want to give my part as a event as much as possible to my juniors also by giving them a best experience of organizing event for others. so the hierarchy of the greatness in the event will continue even after my presence also..and i complete belive that they are capable of that.

i had good experience with the gateways 2023 event itself..by taking care and managing the hospitality support under the guidance of the senior Mr.Karthik on the two days of the gateways event.. Because of that i had the good experience with organizing events for the gateways.
