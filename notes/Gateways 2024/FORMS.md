To enhance and analyze the quality of a satellite image using frequency-based filtering techniques, we'll follow these steps systematically. First, we'll apply Fourier Transform to decompose the image into the frequency domain. Then, we'll implement six different filtering techniques: Ideal Low Pass and High Pass Filters, Butterworth Low Pass and High Pass Filters, and Gaussian Low Pass and High Pass Filters. For each filter, we will vary the cutoff radius and analyze its effect on the image quality.

Hereâ€™s the complete Python code with explanations for each step:

### 1. Import Necessary Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Function to display images
def display_image(img, title, cmap='gray'):
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
    plt.imshow(img, cmap=cmap)
    plt.title(title)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()
```

### 2. Load the Satellite Image and Convert it to Grayscale

```python
# Load image
image = cv2.imread('image.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Display original image
display_image(image, 'Original Image')
```

### 3. Fourier Transform and Shift to Frequency Domain

```python
# Apply Fourier Transform to the image
f_transform = np.fft.fft2(image)
f_transform_shift = np.fft.fftshift(f_transform)

# Magnitude Spectrum of the frequency domain
magnitude_spectrum = 20 * np.log(np.abs(f_transform_shift))

# Display frequency representation
display_image(magnitude_spectrum, 'Magnitude Spectrum')
```

### 4. Define Filters

We will define the different filters: Ideal Low Pass/High Pass, Butterworth Low Pass/High Pass, and Gaussian Low Pass/High Pass. Each will be parameterized by a cutoff radius.

```python
# Function to create an Ideal Low Pass filter
def ideal_low_pass(shape, cutoff):
    rows, cols = shape
    center = (rows // 2, cols // 2)
    mask = np.zeros((rows, cols))
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if np.sqrt((i - center[0])**2 + (j - center[1])**2) <= cutoff:
                mask[i, j] = 1
    return mask

# Function to create an Ideal High Pass filter
def ideal_high_pass(shape, cutoff):
    return 1 - ideal_low_pass(shape, cutoff)

# Function to create a Butterworth Low Pass filter
def butterworth_low_pass(shape, cutoff, n):
    rows, cols = shape
    center = (rows // 2, cols // 2)
    mask = np.zeros((rows, cols))
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            distance = np.sqrt((i - center[0])**2 + (j - center[1])**2)
            mask[i, j] = 1 / (1 + (distance / cutoff)**(2 * n))
    return mask

# Function to create a Butterworth High Pass filter
def butterworth_high_pass(shape, cutoff, n):
    return 1 - butterworth_low_pass(shape, cutoff, n)

# Function to create a Gaussian Low Pass filter
def gaussian_low_pass(shape, cutoff):
    rows, cols = shape
    center = (rows // 2, cols // 2)
    mask = np.zeros((rows, cols))
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            distance = np.sqrt((i - center[0])**2 + (j - center[1])**2)
            mask[i, j] = np.exp(-(distance**2) / (2 * (cutoff**2)))
    return mask

# Function to create a Gaussian High Pass filter
def gaussian_high_pass(shape, cutoff):
    return 1 - gaussian_low_pass(shape, cutoff)
```

### 5. Apply Filters and Visualize Results

We will apply each filter to the frequency domain of the image and then transform it back to the spatial domain for visualization.

```python
# Function to apply filter and inverse transform
def apply_filter(image, filter_mask):
    f_transform = np.fft.fft2(image)
    f_transform_shift = np.fft.fftshift(f_transform)
    filtered_shift = f_transform_shift * filter_mask
    filtered_transform = np.fft.ifftshift(filtered_shift)
    filtered_image = np.fft.ifft2(filtered_transform)
    return np.abs(filtered_image)

# Define a list of cutoff radii to analyze
cutoff_radii = [30, 60, 90, 120]

# Apply Ideal Low Pass Filter
for radius in cutoff_radii:
    ideal_lp_mask = ideal_low_pass(image.shape, radius)
    filtered_image = apply_filter(image, ideal_lp_mask)
    display_image(filtered_image, f'Ideal Low Pass Filter - Radius: {radius}')
    
# Apply Ideal High Pass Filter
for radius in cutoff_radii:
    ideal_hp_mask = ideal_high_pass(image.shape, radius)
    filtered_image = apply_filter(image, ideal_hp_mask)
    display_image(filtered_image, f'Ideal High Pass Filter - Radius: {radius}')

# Apply Butterworth Low Pass Filter
n = 2  # order of the filter
for radius in cutoff_radii:
    butter_lp_mask = butterworth_low_pass(image.shape, radius, n)
    filtered_image = apply_filter(image, butter_lp_mask)
    display_image(filtered_image, f'Butterworth Low Pass Filter - Radius: {radius}')

# Apply Butterworth High Pass Filter
for radius in cutoff_radii:
    butter_hp_mask = butterworth_high_pass(image.shape, radius, n)
    filtered_image = apply_filter(image, butter_hp_mask)
    display_image(filtered_image, f'Butterworth High Pass Filter - Radius: {radius}')

# Apply Gaussian Low Pass Filter
for radius in cutoff_radii:
    gauss_lp_mask = gaussian_low_pass(image.shape, radius)
    filtered_image = apply_filter(image, gauss_lp_mask)
    display_image(filtered_image, f'Gaussian Low Pass Filter - Radius: {radius}')

# Apply Gaussian High Pass Filter
for radius in cutoff_radii:
    gauss_hp_mask = gaussian_high_pass(image.shape, radius)
    filtered_image = apply_filter(image, gauss_hp_mask)
    display_image(filtered_image, f'Gaussian High Pass Filter - Radius: {radius}')
```

### 6. Analysis and Interpretation

- **Ideal Low Pass Filter**: As the cutoff radius increases, the image retains more low-frequency components, resulting in a blurred image but with smoother transitions.
- **Ideal High Pass Filter**: Higher cutoff radii highlight the edges and sharp details of the image, as high-frequency components are preserved.
- **Butterworth Filters**: These provide a smoother transition between preserved and discarded frequencies, with sharper images as the cutoff radius increases.
- **Gaussian Filters**: Like the Butterworth filter, but with an even smoother falloff. The Low Pass Filter smoothens the image, while the High Pass Filter emphasizes the edges.

The ideal filter depends on whether you want to highlight finer details (use High Pass) or smooth out the image (use Low Pass). Adjusting the cutoff radius allows you to control the balance between high and low-frequency content.
